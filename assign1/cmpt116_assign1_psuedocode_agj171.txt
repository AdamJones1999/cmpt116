
Problem 2:



let income = income entered by user

if single


    {

    if income <= 32,000
 

        {10% bracket}   
   
    else


        {25% bracket}  

    } 

else


    {

    if income <= 64,000

        {10% bracket}

    else


        {25% bracket
}
        
    }




Pronblem 3 ii:



let (day1, hour1, minute1) = first time obtained from user



let (day2, hour2, minute2) = second time obtained from user



if day1 < day2                                          

    { first time is earlier than the second }



else if day1 > day2



    { second time is eariler than the second }



else


    
{                                                  

 

   if hour1 < hour 2

 

       { first time is earlier than second time }



    else if hour1 > hour2



        { second time is earlier than first time }



    else

 

       { if minute1 < minute2

 

           { first time is earlier than second time }



        else if minute1 > minute2



            { second time is earlier than first time }



        else if minute1 = minute2



            { both times are the same }



        }



    }


/*this solution only works if the abstraction of time does not go above days,
but thats beyond the scope of the question at hand*/



Problem 4 ii:



let r = random integer between 1 and 100



let g = number guessed by user



let numGuess = 0                           	

if g = r



    { let numGuess = numGuess + 1 }

    { say: “you got it on your first attempt!” }

else


    { numGuess = numGuess + 1 }


    { let oldguess = g }

 

   { say : “try again” }




    while g is not equal to r



	{

        { if abs(g - r} < abs(oldguess - r)



            { say: “getting warmer.  try again.”

 

               let oldguess = g }



        else if abs(g - r) > abs(oldguess - r)



            { say: “getting cooler. try again.”

 

               let oldguess = g }



        else



              { say: “get serious!  that’s exactly the same guess!  try again.” }

    

    { let numGuess = numGuess + 1 }     

        }



    { let numGuess = numGuess + 1 }

    { say: “you got it! in ” , numGuess , " attempts" 

}
