Problem 2:

if single
    {
    if income <= 32,000
        {
        10% bracket
        }
    else
        {
        25% bracket
        }
else
    if income <= 64,000
        {
        10% bracket
        }
    else
        {
        25% bracket
        }
    }

Pronblem 3 ii:

let (day1, hour1, minute1) = first time obtained from user

let (day2, hour2, minute2) = second time obtained from user

if day1 < day2                                          //start new

    {first time is earlier than the second}

else if day1 > day2

    {second time is eariler than the second}

else
    
    {                                                  //end new 

    if hour1 < hour 2 

       { first time is earlier than second time }

    else if hour1 > hour2

       { second time is earlier than first time}

    else 

       { if minute1 < minute2 

           { first time is earlier than second time }

         else if minute1 > minute2

           { second time is earlier than first time }

         else if minute1 = minute2

           { both times are the same }

       }

    }

Problem 4 ii:

let r = random integer between 1 and 100

let g = number guessed by user

let numGuess = 0                                //new

if g = r

  { say: “you got it on first attempt!” }

else

  { let oldguess = g 

   { say : “try again” }


    while g is not equal to r

       { if abs(g - r} < abs(oldguess - r)

            { say: “getting warmer.  try again.” 

              let oldguess = g }

         else if abs(g - r) > abs(oldguess - r)

            { say: “getting cooler. try again.” 

              let oldguess = g }

         else

            { say: “get serious!  that’s exactly the same guess!  try again.” }    

        {let numGuess = numGuess +1}            //new

      }

     say: “you got it!”
